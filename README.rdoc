= HTTPI

HTTPI provides a common interface for different HTTP libraries.

== Supported libraries

* {httpclient}[http://rubygems.org/gems/httpclient] ~> 2.1.5
* {curb}[http://rubygems.org/gems/curb] ~> 0.7.8

== Getting started

To get started, simply create a new HTTPI::Client:

  client = HTTPI::Client.new :curb

Notice that when you're not passing a library to use, HTTPI will default to use the HTTPClient library:

  HTTPI::Adapter.use  # => :httpclient

Changing the default is fairly easy:

  HTTPI::Adapter.use = :curb

== Supported methods

=== headers

Accessor for the HTTP request headers:

  client.headers = { "Accept-Encoding" => "gzip" }
  client.headers  # => { "Accept-Encoding" => "gzip" }

=== get(url)

Sending an HTTP GET request:

  client.get "http://example.com"

=== post(url, body)

Sending an HTTP POST request:

  client.get "http://example.com", "<some>xml</xml>"

== HTTPI::Response

Every HTTP request method is supposed to return an HTTPI::Response containing the response code, headers and body.

  response = client.get "http://example.com"
  
  response.code     # => 200
  response.headers  # => { "Content-Encoding" => "gzip" }
  response.body     # => "<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC ..."

== Participate

I would appreciate any help to support additional libraries and methods!

== TODO

Implement methods for:

* Authentication (HTTP basic/digest and NTLM auth)
* SSL configuration
* Proxy server
* Timeouts
